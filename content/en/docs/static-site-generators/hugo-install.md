  Hugo was my second static site generator after Jekyll. Now it's my favorite SSG. It has many nice features but its strongest advantage is the build timeâ€”the fastest among all other SSGs. In this article I will show you how to install Hugo on your Windows computer.

## Install Chocolatey

> First, go to the official [Hugo installation page](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). As you see, there's more than one way to skin a cat. I choose the Chocolatey option to install Hugo.

To install Chocolatey:

1. Enter the following command in the Command Prompt. Press **Enter**.

    ```powershell
    @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command " [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
    ```

2. Check if you have Chocolatey installed: `choco version`

## Install Hugo

There are two versions of Hugo: standard and extended. Install the extended version as some themes require it.

1. To install the Hugo extended version using Chocolatey, enter:

    `choco install hugo-extended -confirm`

2. To check if Hugo is installed:

    `hugo version`

    Now you are ready to start your journey with Hugo static site generator.
